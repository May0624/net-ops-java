# Net Ops for Java
Net Ops for Java is a toolkit for implementing non-blocking network clients and servers in Java on top of Java NIO.

Net Ops is focused on our own fast, versatile network protocol IAP, but may get some support for other network protocols
too.

Net Ops is ideal for implementing client-server communication internally in your system, e.g. between internal services,
where HTTP, REST, SOAP and Web Sockets may work, but arent' exactly ideal, and where HTTP isn't really necessary.
